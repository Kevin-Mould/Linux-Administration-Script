# Linux Administration Tool.sh
This BASH script is designed to assist you in administrating and monitoring a Linux distribution. Some features include adding and removing users, changing passwords, checking for failed login attempts and showing active network connections to your system. All of these commands are built into the base Linux distributions, however if you are using a minimal installation you might have to install the net-tools package from the package manager in order to use the "4. Display active network connections" option.
